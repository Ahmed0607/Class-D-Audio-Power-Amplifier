# Class-D-Audio-Power-Amplifier
This project involves the design and simulation of a Class D Power Amplifier, a high-efficiency switching amplifier topology. Unlike linear amplifiers (Class A/B), this design utilizes PWM to switch output transistors fully on or off, theoretically achieving 100% efficiency.  It bridges the gap between Analog Electronics and Signal Processing.
